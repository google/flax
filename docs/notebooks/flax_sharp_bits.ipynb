    "## 🔪 `flax.linen.Dropout` layer and randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on a model with dropout (subclassed from [Flax `Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/flax_basics.html#module-basics)), add the `'dropout'` PRNGkey only during the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with [`jax.random.split()`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.random.split.html#jax-random-split) to explicitly create PRNG keys for `'params'` and `'dropout'`.\n",
    "2. Add the [`flax.linen.Dropout`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/_autosummary/flax.linen.Dropout.html#flax.linen.Dropout) layer(s) to your model (subclassed from Flax [`Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/flax_basics.html#module-basics)).\n",
    "3. When initializing the model ([`flax.linen.init()`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#init-apply)), there's no need to pass in an extra `'dropout'` PRNG key—just the `'params'` key like in a \"simpler\" model.\n",
    "4. During the forward pass with [`flax.linen.apply()`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#init-apply), pass in `rngs={'dropout': dropout_key}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out a full example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internally, `flax.linen.Dropout` makes use of [`flax.linen.Module.make_rng`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#flax.linen.Module.make_rng) to create a key for dropout (check out the [source code](https://github.com/google/flax/blob/5714e57a0dc8146eb58a7a06ed768ed3a17672f9/flax/linen/stochastic.py#L72)).\n",
    "- Every time `make_rng` is called (in this case, it's done implicitly in `Dropout`), you get a new PRNG key split from the main/root PRNG key.\n",
    "- `make_rng` still _guarantees full reproducibility_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The [dropout](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) stochastic regularization technique randomly removes hidden and visible units in a network. Dropout is a random operation, requiring a PRNG state, and Flax (like JAX) uses [Threefry](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/docs/jep/263-prng.md) PRNG that is splittable. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Recall that JAX has an explicit way of giving you PRNG keys: you can fork the main PRNG state (such as `key = jax.random.PRNGKey(seed=0)`) into multiple new PRNG keys with `key, subkey = jax.random.split(key)`. Refresh your memory in [🔪 JAX - The Sharp Bits 🔪 Randomness and PRNG keys](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#random-numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flax provides an _implicit_ way of handling PRNG key streams via [Flax `Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/flax_basics.html#module-basics)'s [`flax.linen.Module.make_rng`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#flax.linen.Module.make_rng) helper function. It allows the code in Flax `Module`s (or its sub-`Module`s) to \"pull PRNG keys\". `make_rng` guarantees to provide a unique key each time you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Recall that [`flax.linen.Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#module) is the base class for all neural network modules. All layers and models are subclassed from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that each of the Flax PRNG streams has a name. The example below uses the `'params'` stream for initializing parameters, as well as the `'dropout'` stream. The PRNG key provided to [`flax.linen.init()`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#init-apply) is the one that seeds the `'params'` PRNG key stream. To draw PRNG keys during the forward pass (with dropout), provide a PRNG key to seed that stream (`'dropout'`) when you call `Module.apply()`."
