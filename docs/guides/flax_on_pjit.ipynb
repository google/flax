    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to scale up Flax Modules on multiple devices and hosts using JAX's [`pjit`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.experimental.pjit.html#module-jax.experimental.pjit) and [`flax.linen.spmd`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#module-flax.linen.spmd).\n",

    "## Flax and `pjit`\n",
    "\n",
    "[`jax.experimental.pjit`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.experimental.pjit.html) provides a way to automatically compile and scale up JAX computations. It provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pjit` has the similar interface of [`jax.jit`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html) and works as a decorator on a function that needs to be compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using `pjit`, you can write code as if it runs on a single device, and `pjit` will automatically compile and run it on multiple devices using the [Single Program Multi Data (SPMD)](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SPMD) paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "* With `pjit` you can state how the input and output of your code is partitioned across devices, and the compiler will figure out how to partition everything inside, and how to compile inter-device communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For more information, refer to [JAX-101 pjit tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/08-pjit.html) and [JAX in multi-process environments](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_process.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flax provides a few API to help you use `pjit` on Flax Modules, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interface to specify partitions of your data when defining [`flax.linen.Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen.html#module).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Utility function to generate the partition information that `pjit` requires to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interface to customize your axis names called \"logical axis annotations\" to decouple both your Module code and partition plan to experiment with different partition layouts more easily.\n"
