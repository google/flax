Flax NNX vs JAX transformations
===============================

This guide describes the differences between
`Flax NNX transformations <https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/transforms.html>`__
and `JAX transformations <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key-concepts.html#transformations>`__,
and how to seamlessly switch between them or use them side-by-side. The examples here will focus on
``nnx.jit``, ``jax.jit``, ``nnx.grad`` and ``jax.grad`` function transformations (transforms).

First, let's set up imports and generate some dummy data:

.. testcode:: Flax NNX, JAX

  from flax import nnx
  import jax

  x = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(0), (1, 2))
  y = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(1), (1, 3))

Differences
***********

Flax NNX transformations can transform functions that are not pure and make mutations and
side-effects:
- Flax NNX transforms enable you to transform functions that take in Flax NNX graph objects as
arguments - such as ``nnx.Module``, ``nnx.Rngs``, ``nnx.Optimizer``, and so on - even those whose state
will be mutated.
- In comparison, these kinds of objects aren't recognized in JAX transformations.

The Flax NNX `Functional API <https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx/nnx_basics.html#the-functional-api>`_
provides a way to convert graph structures to `pytrees <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/working-with-pytrees.html>`__
and back. By doing this at every function boundary you can effectively use graph structures with any
JAX transforms and propagate state updates in a way consistent with functional purity.

Flax NNX custom transforms, such as ``nnx.jit`` and ``nnx.grad``, simply remove the boilerplate, and
as a result the code looks stateful.

Below is an example of using the ``nnx.jit`` and ``nnx.grad`` transforms compared to the
the code that uses ``jax.jit`` and ``jax.grad`` transforms.

Notice that:

- The function signature of Flax NNX-transformed functions can accept the ``nnx.Linear``
  ``nnx.Module`` instances directly and make stateful updates to the ``Module``.
- The function signature of JAX-transformed functions can only accept the pytree-registered
  ``nnx.State`` and ``nnx.GraphDef`` objects, and must return an updated copy of them to maintain the
  purity of the transformed function.

Mixing Flax NNX and JAX transforms
**********************************

Both Flax NNX transforms and JAX transforms can be mixed together, so long as the JAX-transformed function
in your code is pure and has valid argument types that are recognized by JAX.
