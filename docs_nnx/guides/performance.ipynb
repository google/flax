    "Currently, Flax [`nnx.jit`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/transforms.html#flax.nnx.jit) traverses the object graph in pure Python which can add overhead. This overhead mostly affects small to medium models and can be mitigated in the following ways:\n",
    "* By leveraging JAX's [Asynchronous dispatch](#asynchronous-dispatch).\n",
    "* By using [nnx.cache_args](#caching-graph-node-traversals) to cache the graph node traversals.\n",
    "* By using a [Functional training loop](#functional-training-loop) which stages out the graph traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full resolution _might_ involve developing a C extension (e.g. `flaxlib`) to speed up some of the traversal logic in [`graph.py`](https://github.com/google/flax/blob/main/flax/nnx/graph.py). Before we continue lets an example of a model and a simple training loop:"

    "## Asynchronous dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous dispatch is a feature of JAX where it runs operations in the background whenever possible so Python can continue executing other code. This can be use to absorve the cost of data loading and in this case the overhead of `nnx.jit` and similar transforms. In general, as the amount of computation JAX has to perform per iteration increases the more it is able to absorve the python overhead since eventually the JAX computation will be the main blocker and programs with different overhead will have the same performance. This could be achieved in a couple of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increasing the batch size.\n",
    "* Increasing the model size.\n",
    "* Performing more JAX steps per python step if data loading is fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, the graph below which shows total time of running [benchmarks/nnx_simple_training.py](https://github.com/google/flax/blob/main/benchmarks/nnx_simple_training.py) for both `jax.jit` and `nnx.jit` with different model sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![performance-graph](images/performance-graph.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Caching graph node traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to get rid of the traversal overhead entirely is by using `nnx.cache_args` to convert a transformed function and the input graph objects into a partial function which caches the graph object and just expects the remaining arguments. In this example we use `nnx.cache_args` over `train_step` and partially apply `model`, `optimizer`, and `metrics`, to create `cached_train_step`. Then we simply update our training loop to use `cached_train_step` which only expects the `x` and `y` inputs:"

This is actually what is expected for most step functions as making any change here would imply costly recompilation, so enforcing this might be a secondary feature that could be useful for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to prevent the user from mutating the cached objects outside, `cache_args` creates a copy of all the graph nodes but, to allow state to be propagated to the original objects, they share references to the same `Variable`s."

    "To remove the Python overhead we can create a functional training loop that uses regular `jax.jit` in combination with `nnx.split` and `nnx.merge` to stage out the traversal logic. Concretely we can use [`nnx.split`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/graph.html#flax.nnx.split) before the training loop to create a single `graphdef` and `state` pytrees for all the graph nodes. Then we change `train_step()` to accept `graphdef` and `state`, and use [`nnx.merge`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/graph.html#flax.nnx.merge) to recreate the objects inside, and either `nnx.split` or `nnx.state` at the end to get the output `state`. At the end of the training loop or whenever needed we can use [`nnx.update`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/graph.html#flax.nnx.update) to update the objects to the current `state`."
