    "# Performance Considerations\n",
    "Currently `nnx.jit` traverses the object graph in pure Python, this is slow and adds overhead. To solve this in general we will be developing a Rust extension called `flaxlib` (see first steps in #4196) to speedup some of the traversal logic in `graph.py`, similar to how JAX solved the same issue with `jaxlib` for standard pytrees. However, there's two things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The overhead is only relevant for small models. See [Asynchronous dispatch](#asynchronous-dispatch).\n",
    "* You can remove the overhead by using `jax.jit` + `nnx.split` / `nnx.merge` to stage out the traversal logic. See [Lowering the Python Overhead](#lowering-the-python-overhead).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asynchronous dispatch\n",
    "In [benchmarks/nnx_simple_training.py](https://github.com/google/flax/blob/main/benchmarks/nnx_simple_training.py) we are increasing the layer width (features per layer) and measuring the total training time for the same model trained both with `nnx.jit` and `jax.jit`. As you can see in the graph below, after a certain model size the time spent in the traversal is completely absorbed by async dispatch. This happens when Python is able to finish the current for loop step, and reach the next `train_step` and JAX is still not done with the previous `train_step`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![performance-graph](images/performance-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you only need to worry about the `nnx.jit` overhead for small models. If you are working with a small model, check out the next section to see how you can remove the overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lowering the Python Overhead\n",
    "To remove the python overhead you can use regular `jax.jit` in combination with `nnx.split` and `nnx.merge` to stage out the traversal logic. To learn how to do this, lets first create this simple model:"

Next we change `train_step` so accept `graphdef` and `state` and use `nnx.merge` and `nnx.split` at the beginning and end of `train_step` to switch back and forth between the objects and their pytree representations.
